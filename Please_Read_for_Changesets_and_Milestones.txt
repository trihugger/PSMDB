PROJECT SILVERMOON MANGOS DATABASE

Home Page: http://project-silvermoon.net/
SVN: http://svn.assembla.com/svn/psmdb_wotlk
Single SQL Path : http://svn.assembla.com/svn/psmdb_wotlk/Development/database
Milestones & Changesets Path : http://svn.assembla.com/svn/psmdb_wotlk
Server Binaries: http://project-silvermoon.net/index.php?showtopic=77

For Changesets & Milestones, we have moved all of those too our secondary
svn, which can be located at :

http://svn.assembla.com/svn/PSDBM/

The reason : we want our main svn to house the single sql files & .bat
importer tool, as this is the proper use of a true svn, we feel that full releases
are "extras". 

As for changesets, we know these are a vital part of updating an existing database, 
and we will continue with those as well.

Also, the old svn setup was over 300+ megs, which was way to much for a download,
this allows us too manage the svn better.

 Thank you - Imperium
