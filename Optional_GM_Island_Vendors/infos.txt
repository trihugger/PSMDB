This patch for custom GM vendor on GM island

1- currently this vendors can only be seen by GM char in mode .gm on to prevent possible abuse from hack telport users - if you want to allow every player to see them set phasemask = 1 by applying this code after patch:

update creature set phasemask = 1 where id between 155000 and 155044;
update creature set phasemask = 1 where id IN(29089,32841);

2- if you want to remove this vendors and related spawn apply patch "remove_gm_island_vendors.sql" on db mangos
